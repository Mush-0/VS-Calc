# Violent Sun "VS" material calculator

[VS Calculator](https://mush-0.github.io/VS-Calc/)
This is a calculator for violent sun raid in Soulworker Global on steam based on the JP server.

# How to use it

You just change the values of the "**Amount to craft**" to what you are going to craft then click "**Calculate**" button \
That easy

# Other tools

I made another tool [Damage Chart](https://mush-0.github.io/sw-dmg-chart/) to draw a chart representing "**damage dealt**" against varying "**AB**" and "**BD**".
